## 🛠️ How to Use nmap-mcp

Once installed, nmap-mcp offers an easy interface to run scans. Here are common tasks:

### Run a Port Scan

1. Enter the IP address or domain name you want to check.
2. Choose the type of scan - simple port scan or full scan.
3. Click “Start Scan.”
4. Wait for the results which show open ports and the services on them.

### Service Detection & OS Fingerprinting

nmap-mcp can guess what software runs on the open ports and which OS the device uses. This helps you understand what equipment or systems are on the network.

### Vulnerability Scanning

The AI component checks scanned devices for common security problems. The app will point out weak spots you should fix.

### Save and Export Results

You can save scan results to files in common formats like CSV or PDF. This makes it easier to share or review later.
